Implementation of apriori algorithm and fp-tree for association rules.
To run the program, save the dataset as data.txt(replace the original one), execute python3 apriori.py or python3 fp_growth.py
For more detailed experiment results, please refer to the report.

NOTE: mlextend package is only used for frequent itemset to rule generation, the apriori/fp-growth part is implementedby myself.
